# R Test Adapter for Visual Studio Code

This extension is built to help you run R tests on VSCode. Currently only `testthat` framework is supported, but running individual tests is now possible contrary to the file-based atomicity of testthat API.

This repository is a plug-in `Test Adapter` extension that works with the
[Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer). User does not need to install the `Test Explorer` extension manually, it will automatically be integrated.
